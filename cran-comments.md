Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This updates the test infrastructure to be compatible with the new version of testthat. My apologies for the delay in submitting the update to this package. 
This time I also fix the use of title case in the title -- my apologies for failing to implement this change in the original submission of this update.

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
