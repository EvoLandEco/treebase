  abstract	= {Numerous evolutionary studies have sought to explain the
		  distribution of diversity across the limbs of the tree of
		  life. At the same time, ecological studies have sought to
		  explain differences in diversity and relative abundance
		  within and among ecological communities. Traditionally,
		  these patterns have been considered separately, but models
		  that consider processes operating at the level of
		  individuals, such as neutral biodiversity theory (NBT), can
		  provide a link between them. Here, we compare evolutionary
		  dynamics across a suite of NBT models. We show that NBT can
		  yield phylogenetic tree topologies with imbalance closely
		  resembling empirical observations. In general,
		  metacommunities that exhibit greater disparity in abundance
		  are characterized by more imbalanced phylogenetic trees.
		  However, NBT fails to capture the tempo of diversification
		  as represented by the distribution of branching events
		  through time. We suggest that population-level processes
		  might therefore help explain the asymmetry of phylogenetic
		  trees, but that tree shape might mislead estimates of
		  evolutionary rates unless the diversification process is
		  modeled explicitly.},

  abstract	= {Animal taxa show remarkable variability in species
		  richness across phylogenetic groups. Most explanations for
		  this disparity postulate that taxa with more species have
		  phenotypes or ecologies that cause higher diversification
		  rates (i.e., higher speciation rates or lower extinction
		  rates). Here we show that clade longevity, and not
		  diversification rate, has primarily shaped patterns of
		  species richness across major animal clades: more diverse
		  taxa are older and thus have had more time to accumulate
		  species. Diversification rates calculated from 163
		  species-level molecular phylogenies were highly consistent
		  within and among three major animal phyla (Arthropoda,
		  Chordata, Mollusca) and did not correlate with species
		  richness. Clades with higher estimated diversification
		  rates were younger, but species numbers increased with
		  increasing clade age. A fossil-based data set also revealed
		  a strong, positive relationship between total extant
		  species richness and crown group age across the orders of
		  insects and vertebrates. These findings do not negate the
		  importance of ecology or phenotype in influencing
		  diversification rates, but they do show that clade
		  longevity is the dominant signal in major animal
		  biodiversity patterns. Thus, some key innovations may have
		  acted through fostering clade longevity and not by
		  heightening diversification rate.},

  abstract	= {Clades diversify in an ecological context, but most
		  macroevolutionary models do not directly encapsulate
		  ecological mechanisms that influence speciation and

		  and magnoliophyte phylogenies had a majority of clades that
		  showed rapid lineage accumulation early with a slowing more
		  recently, whereas a small but significant minority showed
		  accelerated lineage accumulation in their recent histories.
		  Previous analyses have demonstrated that macroevolutionary

		  simply manipulating the degree of ecological
		  differentiation of new species at the time of speciation.
		  Specifically, the metacommunity model predicts that clades
		  showing decelerating lineage accumulation rates are those
		  that have diversified by ecological modes of speciation,
		  whereas clades showing accelerating lineage accumulation
		  rates are those that have diversified primarily by modes of

  abstract	= {A characteristic signature of adaptive radiation is a
		  slowing of the rate of speciation toward the present. On
		  the basis of molecular phylogenies, studies of single
		  clades have frequently found evidence for a slowdown in
		  diversification rate and have interpreted this as evidence
		  for density dependent speciation. However, we demonstrated
		  via simulation that large clades are expected to show
		  stronger slowdowns than small clades, even if the
		  probability of speciation and extinction remains constant
		  through time. This is a consequence of exponential growth:
		  clades, which, by chance, diversify at above the average
		  rate early in their history, will tend to be large. They
		  will also tend to regress back to the average
		  diversification rate later on, and therefore show a
		  slowdown. We conducted a meta-analysis of the distribution
		  of speciation events through time, focusing on
		  sequence-based phylogenies for 45 clades of birds. Thirteen
		  of the 23 clades (57\%) that include more than 20 species
		  show significant slowdowns. The high frequency of slowdowns
		  observed in large clades is even more extreme than expected
		  under a purely stochastic constant-rate model, but is
		  consistent with the adaptive radiation model. Taken
		  together, our data strongly support a model of
		  density-dependent speciation in birds, whereby speciation
		  slows as ecological opportunities and geographical space
		  place limits on clade growth.},
